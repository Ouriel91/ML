1. This data set has no missing data and categorial data (but in real-world sometimes we need to do preprocessing data), the dataset was taken from the UCI ML repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets
2. All of these files are templates that should predict the last column - dependent variable
3. That data is related to energy but as said above we don't need to know how it works
4. I'll add my code folder just for practice
5. the main goal of this Regression folder is to choose the correct model for this dataset
